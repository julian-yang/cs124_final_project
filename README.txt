To run for the input using 0/1/2 as # of alternate alleles, use
final_project.py.  The branch_and_bound() function actually uses 0/1 as
homozygous sites and 2 as heterozygous sites.  final_project.py does the
necessary input file reading as well as conversion.  To add files to be run,
modify the list 'input_files' with the filenames of the input matrices RELATIVE
TO final_project.py
